# week 8:
**q-fs-bytes_extractor**: coverage over basic file operations, like fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), fseek().
**q-fs-bytes_extractor_errors**: part 2 of the question, just to cover checking for errors.

**q-fs-print_metadata**: basic coverage of stat, including file size and permissions. 
I find that in week 8, trying to cover the basics of file operations as well as the question q-fs-chmod-if-public-write.html is too much, both time and content wise, so this is a simpler, faster that just goes over the basics of file permission conversions and doesn't bother with chmod function as well.

# week 9: 

**q-fs-recurse_sample**: the tutorial questions lack practice into recursion, which appears every exam. this aims to plug that hole.
